              <p>An image gallery is essential for the websites because website visitors are scared of long texts. Instead, they rather websites which have images, graphics, and even several sliding images at once (IONOS Digitalguide). There are varieties of methods to create photo galleries. First method is embedding a Lightbox image gallery with source code in JavaScript. Through this method, which was developed by Lokesh Dhaka’s in 2005 (IONOS Digitalguide), the photo gallery will be implemented via HTML. Another method is the Image gallery extension for content management systems. This is the pre-built framework for users, even the users who have no IT knowledge. For example, for the open source content management system named WordPress, NextGen, Envira, and Polaroid are the beautiful, and accessible galleries.
