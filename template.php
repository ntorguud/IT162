    <p>I am Naran Torguud. I was born and grew up in Mongolia. Since I was in a middle school, I have wondered how people discovered those scientific inventions, such as coding. However, I completed a bachelor's degree in Textile Design in my country, I have never forgotten my dream which is learning code. After I graduated, I started to work at Mongolia's leading Cashmere Fashion company called "Gobi Cashmere" for 5 years.
